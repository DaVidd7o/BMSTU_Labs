The pain and sorrow left us hollowNo tomorrows hard to swallowDeath is calling so appallingTightrope walking, now I'm falling downLike missiles falling from the skyCome and save usThe pain and sorrow left us hollowHere today, but gone tomorrowThe pain inside is the fuel that drivesThis flesh and bone through blood red skiesThe death defying, hypnotizingOne day you're gonna figure out thatEverything they taught you was a LIEWatch the world burn
