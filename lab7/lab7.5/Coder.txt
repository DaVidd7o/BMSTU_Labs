The pain and sorrow left us hollow
No tomorrows hard to swallow
Death is calling so appalling
Tightrope walking, now I'm falling down
Like missiles falling from the sky
Come and save us
The pain and sorrow left us hollow
Here today, but gone tomorrow
The pain inside is the fuel that drives
This flesh and bone through blood red skies
The death defying, hypnotizing
One day you're gonna figure out that
Everything they taught you was a LIE
Watch the world burn
