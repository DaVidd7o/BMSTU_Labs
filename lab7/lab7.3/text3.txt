It's a false sense of security that'll outlive us all
Another step in the wrong direction and we'll cut to the core
I wouldn't have to stab you in the back If you'd just turn and face me
Will you just turn and face me?
I'll be waiting for the moment
When you're out of your comfort zone
Are you afraid of realising we're out of control?
Did you know you'll never know?
Did you know that you'll never know?
It's the false sense of authority that will tear us apart
Another step in the wrong direction and we'll cut to the core
If we don't let go
Of our saviours
If we don't let go
Of our saviours
