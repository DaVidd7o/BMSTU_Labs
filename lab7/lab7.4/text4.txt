She was alone in a bathroom
Eyes fixed like a statue
Wrists soar and her face bruised
She just waiting for more bad news
Now she's white like a full moon
As she can't bear what the test proves
At a crossroads, need a rescue
Cause what she gonna do
Hold on
She's waiting between worlds
Wish she could tell 'em hold on
I'm waiting between worlds
